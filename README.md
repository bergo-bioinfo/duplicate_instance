# Duplicate instance module for REDCap

## Features

This module allows to duplicate an instance of REDCap instrument by creating a new one with certain fields copied from the old one.

## Settings

You can configure this module for each project:
1. You have to determine which instrument(s) can be duplicated.
2. For each of these instruments, which fields must be copied to the new instance.
